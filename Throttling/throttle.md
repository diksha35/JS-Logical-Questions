**Throttling : Throttling is a technique that limits the execution of function to once in every specified time interval.**

## 

In JavaScript, throttling refers to a technique used to control the frequency at which a particular function can be executed. It ensures that the function is called at most once within a specified time interval, even if it's invoked multiple times during that period.

Throttling is often used in scenarios where you want to limit the rate of execution of a function, especially in event-driven environments like web browsers. For example, you might throttle the execution of an event handler to prevent it from being triggered too frequently, which could lead to performance issues or unnecessary resource consumption.

The throttling process typically involves delaying the execution of the function and ensuring that it's only called once the specified time interval has elapsed since the last invocation. This helps in optimizing performance, reducing the load on the system, and providing a smoother user experience.

Throttling is commonly implemented using techniques like debouncing or setTimeout/setInterval functions to control the timing of function calls. It's useful in various scenarios such as handling scroll events, resize events, or input events in web applications, where you want to balance responsiveness with performance.

## Use case : Scrolling , input event, window resizing, API rate limiting 

Some common use cases for throttling include:

**1. Scroll Events:** Throttling can be used to limit the rate at which a scroll event handler is called, especially in scenarios where expensive operations like DOM manipulation or AJAX requests are performed based on the scroll position. Throttling ensures that these operations are not executed too frequently, optimizing performance.
**2. Resize Events:** When handling window resize events, throttling can be employed to prevent excessive recalculations or re-rendering of UI elements. By throttling the resize event handler, you can ensure that layout adjustments or responsive design updates are performed in a controlled manner without causing performance bottlenecks.
**3. Input Events:** Throttling is commonly used with input event handlers, such as those for text input fields or search boxes. By throttling the input event, you can delay the execution of operations like autocomplete suggestions or live search queries, providing a smoother user experience while minimizing unnecessary network requests or processing overhead.
**4. AJAX Requests:** Throttling can be applied to AJAX request handlers to limit the rate at which requests are sent to a server. This is particularly useful in scenarios where there's a risk of overwhelming the server with too many requests in a short period. Throttling ensures that requests are spaced out evenly, reducing the load on both the client and server.
**5. User Interaction Events:** Throttling can be used with various user interaction events like clicks, taps, or mouse movements. For example, in a drag-and-drop interface, throttling the mousemove event handler can help in smoother rendering of drag effects without causing performance degradation due to excessive event processing.
**6.API Rate Limiting:** Throttling is essential for API rate limiting, where you want to restrict the number of requests a client can make to an API within a certain time frame. Throttling helps in preventing abuse, ensuring fair usage of resources, and maintaining the stability of the API server.
